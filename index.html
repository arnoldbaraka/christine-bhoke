      <h2>About Mama Arno</h2>
      <p>
        Christine Bhoke Nchamah, fondly known as <strong>Mama Arno</strong>, is a proud daughter of the Kuria West community, 
        a mother of three, and a national leader in community empowerment. She balances family, leadership, and politics 
        with grace and wisdom. Her firstborn, <strong>Arnold (“Arno”)</strong>, serves the nation as a top DevSecOps engineer at Safaricom, 
        deploying critical digital health systems — proof that leadership begins at home and blossoms into service for the country.
